# To-Do-List
This is a basic To-Do list app where you can add your tasks in different categories. <br/>
Use the /work route URL to navigate to the work list. A button for the same will be implemented soon.<br/>
The project uses the Node.js backened framework. It also uses the express and body-parser modules.<br/>

```npm i express``` <br/>
```npm i body-parser``` <br/>

Along with this, it uses the EJS view engine to render the website dynamically. <br/>

Version 1.0 : <br/>
-> Basic functionality of adding or crossing off tasks.<br/>
-> Navigation buttons to be added in next version.<br/>
