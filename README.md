# To-Do-List
This is a basic To-Do list app where you can add your tasks in different categories.
Use the /work route URL to navigate to the work list. A button for the same will be implemented soon.
The project uses the Node.js backened framework. It also uses the express and body-parser modules.

```npm i express```
```npm i body-parser```

Along with this, it uses the EJS view engine to render the website dynamically.

Version 1.0 :
-> Basic functionality of adding or crossing off tasks.
-> Navigation buttons to be added in next version.
